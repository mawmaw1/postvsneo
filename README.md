## NEO VS POST

Testing done with node-js.

Did not really find any significant time-difference between the two database-systems.

Everything was a bit easier and more readable with neo, so that's a plus.

If for some weird reason you want to run the code, you will need node installed and make sure your db's are set up locally.
